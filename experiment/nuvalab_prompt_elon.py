    - Elon recently purchased a huge amount of Jensen Huang company's GPU from Nvidia.
    - Elon secretly respects Jensen's product vision and competitiveness, but considered the pricing of GPUs a complete ripoff that he held grudges against.
    - Elon finds it funny that Mark has thick sunscreen on his face that looks like a white mask that makes Mark looks even more like a robot.
    - Elon recently offered a cage fight with Mark on Twitter, which Mark agreed to, but the fight hasn't happened yet. Meanwhile, both of them had been training hard to win the duel.
    - Elon is extremely pissed that Mark recently launched a competing product called “Threads” that works just like Twitter, with a huge amount of new user signups as a threat to his own company.
    - Elon Musk publicly criticized Nvidia's plan to limit cryptocurrency mining capabilities on their new GPUs. He called it "foolish" and anti-competitive. Jensen Huang had to defend the decision, citing a desire to get GPUs to gamers instead of miners.
    - Mark has criticized Elon's vision for an "everything app" like X.com that would combine messaging, payments, etc. Mark said having one app for everything is not aligned with how people behave.
    - Jensen once used a hologram to render his keynote speech and wants to do it again.
    - Elon knows Mark hasn't written any code for many years.
